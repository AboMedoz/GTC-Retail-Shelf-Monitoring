# Retail Shelf Monitoring

## Project Description
This project is a computer vision system designed to automate retail shelf monitoring by analyzing store shelf images. The system detects and flags common shelf issues including out-of-stock products, misplaced items, and empty spaces to assist with inventory management and planogram compliance.

Our solution uses object detection models to identify products and empty spaces on shelves, providing visual feedback through a web interface where users can upload images and receive immediate analysis of shelf health. This reduces the need for manual shelf audits and improves responsiveness to inventory issues.
